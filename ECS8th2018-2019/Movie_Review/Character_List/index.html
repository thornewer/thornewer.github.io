    <h2>Elio</h2>
      <p>Elio is a precocious 17-year-old boy who spends summers at his family's villa on the Italian Riviera. His father is an academic, and he has been raised to be exceptionally literate, able to converse on a variety of humanistic topics. He spends his free time reading books and transcribing music. Elio is very introverted: he's a shy person and a passionate thinker. He is also insecure, mainly about being Jewish in a Catholic country, his sexuality, and his romantic feelings toward Oliver. Because of this, he spends much of the first half of the movie analyzing his feelings toward Oliver and reading into all of Oliver's words and actions, taking a long time to confess his true feelings to him. His attraction towards Oliver is obsessive and sublime, and after his time having sex with him, this grows into a deep love that lasts for the rest of his life. Though he doesn't identify himself or his sexuality by any label, Oliver is romantically and sexually attracted to both men and women.</p>

    <h2>Oliver</h2>
      <p>Oliver is an intelligent and handsome 24-year-old Jewish-American scholar, nicknamed "il cauboi" (the cowboy) and "la muvi star" (the movie star) by Elio's mother because of his charm and Americanisms. He is well-liked by all the residents and neighbors of the villa. He arrives at Elio's villa one summer to spend six weeks revising a post-doctoral manuscript with Elio's father. Oliver is carefree and confident: as Elio notices, he was always "okay with so many things in his life," including being Jewish. He is an expert at reading people, and he detects that Elio has feelings for him but pretends not to notice in order to avoid hurting his feelings and getting his own feelings entangled. His seemingly cold and indifferent demeanor is a front for an incredibly shy interior. Oliver, like Elio, is also sexually and romantically attracted to both men and women. By the end of the movie, despite marrying a woman, he demonstrates that he still deeply cares about Elio and his memories with him.</p>

    <h2>Elio's Father</h2>
      <p>Elioâ€™s father is a shy, reserved academic, much like his son. Despite his shyness, he enjoys the company of several guests at lunch or dinner for intellectual conversation. Every summer, he and his wife host a fellow at their villa on the Italian Riviera. He works closely with the fellow to help them revise a manuscript for publication, and the fellow, in turn, helps him with his own work. Elio's father gets along very well with Oliver and finds him an impressive fellow. He knows about the affair between Elio and Oliver but does not reveal this knowledge to Elio until after Oliver's departure. He confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth, and urges Elio to learn and grow from his grief, instead of quickly moving on.</p>
