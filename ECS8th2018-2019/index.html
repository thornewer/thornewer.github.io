   <p>I have actually learned so much in this class! I have learned how to type faster, create my own websites, I now know how to put images and videos in my code, I can open links to other websites to that they open in a new tab, I can create lists, and so much more!
      My advice for future ECS students is: Don't be afraid to ask for help! If you are confused, it is so much better to immediately ask questions because everything builds off each other, so make sure you have a good foundation so you can create more complicated code later! Also, have fun with it! Once you know what you are doing, coding will become so interesting and less overwhelming.
