      <h3>Childhood</h3>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Elementary/Middle School:</strong> North Park Elementary School
      <li><strong>Favorite Childhood Story:</strong> When I was in preschool, we weren't allowed to bring our own toys into school, we had to share the ones they already had. So one time I tried to sneek a barbie shoe into the school in my nose. It didn't work.
      <li><strong>Sports:</strong> As a kid, I was involved in a wide range of sports. I started off playing soccer, basketball (for one year), and gymnastics, and then quit soccer after a few years to focus on gymnastics. I was a gymnast for 8 years and then quit before going into middle school. After quitting gymnastics, I struggled to find another sport that I truly loved. I tried dance, lacrosse, volleyball, track and cross country, polevaulting, and even considered ice hockey. Then the summer before high school, my mom made me try rowing. I loved it and have been rowing ever since.
